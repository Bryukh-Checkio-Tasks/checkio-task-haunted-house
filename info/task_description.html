    On the island Stephen discovered the old house. After exploring,
    he found that the house has 16 ( 4x4 ) rooms, but they are connected in a strange way.
    Each room has no more than four doors, but they can enter into any room and not to the neighboring.
    When he was in the last room (#16) he heard a strange sound.
    With the help of his sensors he recognized that in the first room (#1) appeared a ghost.
    You should help Stephen get away from the house.
    To do this, he needs to get into the first room (#1) and does not meet the ghost.

    On the each step you are given three arguments:
    the map of the house, Stephen's location (room's number) and Ghost's location (room's number).
    The map is represented as a list, where each element is connection between rooms.
    Connections are lists of two integers (from 1 to 16 inclusively), that show which rooms are connected.
</p>
<p>
    On each step you should return a room's number, where you want to move Stephen. After your step, the ghost makes its move.
    The ghost has an algorithm for moving. If stephen in a "neighbouring" room, then the ghost will catch him.
    For other cases, the ghost looks at numbers -- if Stephen's room has lesser number than ghost's room,
    then it try to move in rooms with lesser numbers (compare with its number). And versus. If the ghost has several equal variants for move,
    then it makes random choice from priority numbers. For example: Stephen in the 4th room,
    the ghost in the 10th and from this room 4 doors: 2, 6, 12, 14; the ghost randomly select from 2 and 6.
